Gravitational potential energy (GPE) is the stored energy an object has due to its position in a gravitational field. 
It is calculated as: **GPE = mgh**, where **m** is mass, **g** is gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/sÂ² on Earth), and **h** is height above the reference point. 
This energy is converted into kinetic energy when an object falls.
