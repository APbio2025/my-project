A vector quantity is a physical quantity that has both **magnitude and direction**. 
Examples include **velocity, force, displacement, and acceleration**. 
Vectors are represented graphically using arrows, where the length of the arrow indicates magnitude and its orientation indicates direction. 
Vectors obey specific mathematical operations such as addition using the triangle or parallelogram method.
