Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an organismâ€™s DNA to alter its genetic makeup. 
This process involves techniques like recombinant DNA technology, CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and cloning. It is used in medicine (gene therapy), agriculture (GMO crops), and research (creating genetically modified organisms for study). 
Genetic engineering has ethical considerations, including potential environmental impacts and safety concerns.
