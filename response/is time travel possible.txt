Time travel, a concept rooted in relativity theory, challenges our understanding of causality and physics. 
While Einsteinâ€™s theory of relativity suggests time dilation at near-light speeds, paradoxes like the grandfather paradox complicate the idea. 
Key questions: Could wormholes or black holes enable time travel? Would traveling to the past violate fundamental laws of physics? 
How does quantum mechanics fit into the discussion?
