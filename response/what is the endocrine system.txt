The endocrine system is a network of glands that produce hormones to regulate bodily functions. 
It includes the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, and reproductive organs. 
These hormones control metabolism, growth, reproduction, mood, and homeostasis. Disorders of the endocrine system include diabetes (insulin deficiency) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
