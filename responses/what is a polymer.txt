A polymer is a large molecule made up of repeating subunits called monomers. 
Polymers can be **natural** (such as DNA, proteins, and cellulose) or **synthetic** (such as plastics, nylon, and polyethylene). 
They are classified into thermoplastics (which soften upon heating) and thermosetting plastics (which remain rigid upon heating). 
Polymers are widely used in industries such as textiles, packaging, and biomedical engineering.
