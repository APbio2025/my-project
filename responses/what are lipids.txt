Lipids are a diverse group of organic molecules that include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. 
They are primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Their main biological functions include long-term energy storage, cell membrane structure (as phospholipids), and acting as signaling molecules (hormones like steroids). 
Lipids are insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents such as alcohol and ether.
