According to special relativity, as objects approach the speed of light, their energy and mass increase infinitely, making further acceleration impossible. 
This raises questions: Are there undiscovered mechanisms that could bypass this limit? 
Could wormholes or quantum mechanics allow faster-than-light travel? 
How does this limitation shape our understanding of the universe?
