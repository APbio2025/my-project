A redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction is a type of chemical reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between substances. 
- **Oxidation** refers to the loss of electrons (or gain of oxygen). 
- **Reduction** refers to the gain of electrons (or loss of oxygen). 
These reactions are essential in processes like combustion, corrosion, and cellular respiration. An example is the reaction between magnesium and oxygen: 
Mg + O₂ → MgO, where magnesium is oxidized and oxygen is reduced.
