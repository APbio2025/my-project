Hibernation is an adaptation that allows animals to survive harsh environmental conditions, particularly extreme cold and food shortages. 
During hibernation, metabolic rates drop, body temperature decreases, and energy consumption is minimized. 
This process raises critical questions: How do animals decide when to hibernate? What physiological changes occur? 
Could humans ever induce a state of hibernation for medical purposes or space travel?
