A scalar quantity is a physical quantity that has **only magnitude but no direction**. 
Examples include **speed, mass, time, temperature, energy, and volume**. 
Scalars are contrasted with vector quantities, which have both magnitude and direction. 
For example, speed (a scalar) measures how fast an object moves, whereas velocity (a vector) also specifies its direction.
