Aging is a complex biological process influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and cellular mechanisms such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, and telomere shortening. 
Key debates include: Should aging be considered a disease that can be treated? 
What are the ethical implications of extending human lifespan? 
How do different theories of aging (such as the free radical theory) explain age-related decline?
