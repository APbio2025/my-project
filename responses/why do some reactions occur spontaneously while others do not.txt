The spontaneity of a reaction depends on thermodynamic factors such as enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG). 
A reaction is spontaneous when ΔG < 0, but critical questions arise: Can non-spontaneous reactions be driven by external energy inputs (e.g., photosynthesis)? 
Why do some spontaneous reactions occur very slowly (e.g., diamond turning into graphite)?
